# BigCommerceNET
The following project is based on a generic Nuget package library (BigCommerceAccess), which was deprecated for unknown reasons.

The current project refactors such library, using the latest .NET 8.0, and best standards for accessing WebAPIs (HttpClient, etc.) internally.

The Test Project shows a hint at how to use the library and some of the many Models that can be accessed from the BigCommerce store.
